Currently working on
Step 12 - partially complete.  Still need to figure out sequence numbers, acks and timers for this step
Reading +understanding all the information for steps 8-11 (ongoing)
	
Completed
nc and ping weren't working because the ethernet address wasn't set.  Run setup.sh and then check that an appropriate ip address was set/change if necessary
made wrappers for send and recieve packets that should simulate packet loss and corruption (still need to implement reordering)
