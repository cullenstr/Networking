The distance vector algorithm and the associated table printing was implemented by Cullen, 
and the link state algorithm  along with its table printing was done by Lauren. 

Distance vector uses the current link info to calculate the least cost path and gets the next hop for each node destination.
Link state computes least cost paths from one node (‘source”) to all other nodes using Dijkstras.
