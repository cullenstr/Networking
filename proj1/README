Included files
http_client.c - compilable but untested version of http_client using minet functions 
http_server1.c - compilable but untested version of http_server1 using minet functions 
http_server2.c - compilable but untested version of http_server1 using minet functions 
http_server3.c - including so that makefile will function, we did not complete the extra credit 

http_client_k.c - tested and working version of the http_client that runs without minet, utilizing standard networking functions
http_server1_k.c - tested and working version of the http_server1 that runs without minet, utilizing standard networking functions
http_server2_k.c -t ested and working version of the http_server2 that runs without minet, utilizing standard networking functions

Notes on coding choices
We assumed from the project specifications that all the programs were meant to be written using minet compatible functions for the networking  operations.  We have not, of time of this writing, been able to test these minet style programs, and so are including the standard networking versions for reference.  

For the http_client, we delimited the end of the header section by the line "Content-length: %d", but that does not work for all external websites.  For sites that do not include content length as a header field we print all of the output at once to stderr or stdout (depending on the return code).
